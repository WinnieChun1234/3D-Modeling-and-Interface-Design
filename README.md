# 3D-Modeling-and-Interface-Design

This is the second assignment of the computer graphics course. The assignment comes with a template and my tasks were to implement 3D objects
modeler with functions like mouse controlled model editing.


### To implement 3D modeler, I have done the following features in MainFrame.cpp:

1. Implement a few event handlers to handlemodel transformation (rotation, translation and extrusion) for mouse interaction control in LeftMouseMove(float start_x, float start_y, float curr_x, float curr_y); 

2. Draw to visualize the world space in VisualizeWorldSpace().
